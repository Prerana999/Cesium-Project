End-to-End Testing Plan:

End-to-end testing is a software testing method that verifies the entire software, including its integration with external interfaces, 
from beginning to end. End-to-end testing examines the entire software for dependencies, data integrity, and connectivity with other systems, 
interfaces, and databases in order to simulate a complete production environment.

Significance of End-to-End Testing:

End-to-end testing evaluates the entire system flow and boosts confidence by discovering bugs and boosting subsystem test coverage. 
Modern software systems are sophisticated and linked, with various subsystems that may be different from those in use today. 
Failure of any subsystem can bring the entire system down, which is a big risk that can be avoided by End-to-End testing.

Automation Tools and Techniques used in the end-to-end testing:

I have used Selenium Automation tool. Essentially, it's used to automate testing across a variety of web browsers. 
Selenium WebDriver supports a variety of browsers, including Chrome, Mozilla, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer, and allows you to simply 
automate browser testing across different browsers. On your computer screen, you can observe live automated tests being run. This tool is more effecient because
it supports multi-browser compatibilty, open source, language and framework support, easy to implement and flexible.

Selenium also supports a variety of frameworks for automating testing, including Maven, Junit, and TestNG. Jenkins and other CI and CD systems are also supported 
for automating the deployment process. In this testcase development I have used TestNG framework as it has been introduced with new functionalities that makes it more 
powerful and easy to use like annotation, parameter support, support data-driver testing etc.

End-to-End Testing Process for React Redux Application:
The design framework consistes of 3 parts
1. User Fuctions
The main features involved in this testing are given below:
- Type of URL to launch the application, React Redux Application.
- Add, View and React to Post.
- Navigate to User Tab.
- View all users and their respective Post by clicking on the User.
- Navigate to Notification Tab.
- Click on Refresh Notification button to view all the recent posts added.
- Close the application.

2. Conditions
Conditions to check the validity are given below:
- To check the post is added successful by giving the respective input.
- To check the Users and Notification URL navigation.

3. Testcases
The testcases are included in a separate file.
